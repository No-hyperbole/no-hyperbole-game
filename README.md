# No hyperbole

Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. We wanted to play on this word, while creating a game geared towards people practicing yoga who want to learn how to properly breathe.

## Details

This game uses the players' microphone input. Inhalation and exhalation is gamified.

## Datasets

- GEORG FORSTERS ENTDECKUNG DER SÃœDSEE (https://creating-new-dimensions.org/Georg-Forsters-Entdeckung-der-Suedsee/)
- DAMM â€“ Digitales Archiv Mathematischer Modelle (https://creating-new-dimensions.org/Mathematische-Modelle/)
- Sammlung Mathematische Modelle, 1867 (https://wil.e-pics.ethz.ch/main/galleryview/fc=41%3A416)
  Our idea is to use these three data sets:

We want to create a web app, that uses the mathematical models as a fantastic world base for and the birds to populate the world, make it a living scene.

This will be a game that relaxes the player. Soft, ambient music will guide him, the birds distant chirping will make him curious of the world. The marvelous geommetry will encourage this curiosity.

## To-do

AR capatiblities, so the player could enjoy this game in the real world! ðŸ™‚
