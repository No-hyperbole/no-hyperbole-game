# No hyperbole

Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. We wanted to play on this word, while creating a game geared towards people practicing yoga who want to learn how to properly breathe and invocate mantras.

## Details

This game uses the players' microphone input. Inhalation, exhalation and mantra invocations are gamified.

We created a web app, which is targeted towards people who practice yoga. A study in new methods of steering, which don't require any additional accesories. Just your voice. This will be a game that relaxes the player.

We use the microphone to measure the noise levels. Then we use this data to calculate the speed of the character.
